 An experiment to  visualize and analyze player match-ups against specific NBA teams throughout their careers.

Currently the plan is a as follow:
-Scrape all NBA gamelogs from now til 2010 from each active players with more than 10 minutes.
    -In order for the correctgamelogs to be searched without having to manually search and do more calculations, I will pull the players from my mongodb database with their respective url and have it as a list.
-Scrape all active NBA players who played at least 10 minutes career wise. (Completed)
-Scrape all NBA teams currently active with their abbreviations. (Completed)
